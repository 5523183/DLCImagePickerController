DLCImagePickerController is a fast, beautiful and fun way to filter and capture your photos with OpenGL and your iPhone.
The majority of the praise should be directed towards BradLarson for his [GPUImage](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) library.

[Here's a video of it in action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BFljDoJpB8)

### Setup:

When you clone the repo, you'll need to download GPUImage assets:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Examples

Here are some examples of the filters that are included. These are being applied to the live camera stream

It also has a radial blur, that you can move and pinch to your liking and front facing camera

After you capture the image, you can apply new filters and toggle/move/resize the blur as you please or decide to retake it
