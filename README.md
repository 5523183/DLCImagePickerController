DLCImagePickerController is a fast, beautiful and fun way to filter and capture your photos with OpenGL and your iPhone.

The majority of the praise should be directed towards BradLarson for his GPUImage library.

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Here are some examples of the filters that are included. These are being applied to the live camera stream

It also has a radial blur, that you can move and pinch to your liking and front facing camera

After you capture the image, you can apply new filters and toggle/move/resize the blur as you please
